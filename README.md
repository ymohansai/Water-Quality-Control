# Water-Quality-Control

This project analyzes water quality parameters and applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to assess and predict water potability. The goal is to support environmental monitoring and ensure safe drinking water standards.

## Project Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of water quality dataset

Preprocessing and feature engineering for clean analysis

Machine Learning models to classify water potability

Visualization of important factors affecting water safety

## Dataset

The dataset contains chemical properties of water samples, including:

pH

Hardness

Solids

Chloramines

Sulfate

Conductivity

Organic Carbon

Trihalomethanes

Turbidity

Potability (Target variable: Safe / Not Safe)

The dataset was sourced from open data repositories (e.g., Kaggle).

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-quality-control.git
cd water-quality-control
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Open the notebook in Jupyter and run all cells:

jupyter notebook water_quality_control.ipynb


The notebook will:

Perform EDA with graphs and insights

Preprocess data (handling null values, scaling)

Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Evaluate performance with accuracy and other metrics

## Results
